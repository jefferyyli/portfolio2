				<h2 class="case-title">TicketFlip</h2>
				<p class="case-subtitle">Jan 2019</p>
				<p>In the Entertainment industry, there is a risk of selling second-hand tickets due to scammers and scalpers. As seen online, usually on Facebook or any other social media platforms, there are always people sharing stories of how they’ve been scammed.</p>
				<p>There are currently no mechanisms in place to perfectly trade second-hand tickets. The experience can be much better and easier than current methods. This platform is not a marketplace but is more of a tool to assist with the current ticket-trading methods.</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">What problem is this platform solving?</h3>
				<p>When buying and selling second-hand tickets, there is always some sort of distrust between both parties. There is always emotion associated with these transactions as there's always a risk of losing money. The problem I’m trying to solve is the ability for others to trust each other online and making the second-hand ticket trading experience easier for users.</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">User Research</h3>
				<p>The purpose of this research is to collect qualitative data to understand a user's emotions when they buy or sell second-hand tickets online and to listen to anecdotal stories related to this experience. For my research, I interviewed five users.</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">Insights</h3>
				<p>Buyers and sellers will mainly use Facebook as a marketplace for second-hand tickets as there are much more people trading there. Prices are also closer to face-value than a second-hand trading marketplace such as StubHub. People will be typically looking for tickets on the event’s Facebook event page or music-related groups.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When buying a second-hand ticket from strangers on social media such as Facebook, they will try identifying if the seller is a scammer or not by looking at their profile details such as mutual friends, posts and photos</li>
					<li>Even though the other party may seem trustworthy, people will still have the thought of a possibility of getting scammed or cheated for their money</li>
					<li>Users don’t like using second-hand ticket marketplaces such as StubHub because there's no face to the seller and prices are much higher. A study by Adventus has also said that people view these second-hand ticket marketplaces as unethical because of the higher prices (e.g. buying from scalpers and the fees associated with using these marketplaces).</li>
					<li>Users always have the fear of the ticket not scanning upon entry, which may cause embarrassment at the door and dealing with the hassle of finding and buying another ticket.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="sect-title">Ticket Types</h3>
				<p>Afterwards I looked at the type of tickets users would be buying or selling. This chart below explains what each ticket type is and how the ticket itself would be transfered to the buyer.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span style="font-weight: 500">Hardcopy/physical tickets: </span> Transactions that are usually done in person. This platform would see no use in selling this type of ticket.</li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: 500">Will call:</span> Tickets do not exist yet. They would be picked up at a booth on the day of the event at the venue. This platform would talk to the ticketing company to transfer names for will call.</li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: 500">E-tickets (attached):</span> E-Tickets attached to a name or account. E.g. TicketMaster tickets. This platform would automatically transfer from one account to another (similar to TicketMaster transfer).</li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: 500">E-tickets (unattached): </span> E-tickets not attached to an account. The most susceptible type of ticket to get scammed. Usually comes in the form of a pdf. This platform would send the pdf/barcode to the buyer once the transaction is complete.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="sect-title">User Persona</h3>
				<p>After conducting my interviews, I synthesized my research and created a persona based on the users I interviewed.</p>

				<h3 class="sect-title">Jobs-to-be-Done Framework</h3>
				<p>For this project I wanted to try creating a job story using the Jobs-to-be-Done Framework to understand what task the user is doing and why they would hire this product. Some people have said that the JBTD framework can replace personas but instead I used a persona to help me create a job story.</p>
				<img src="assets/images/ticketflip/ticketflip_jbtd.png" data-action="zoom">
				<p>Afterwards I created a <a href="https://medium.com/make-us-proud/jobs-to-be-done-framework-748c761797a8" target=_blank>job story</a> based on the three different criterias.</p>
				<img src="assets/images/ticketflip/ticketflip-jobstory.png" data-action="zoom">
				<h3 class="sect-title">Task Flow</h3>
				<p>Before drawing wireframes, I decided to create the task flow of how transactions would work on TicketFlip to better understand this system.</p>

			<div class="container-case">
				<h3 class="sect-title">Initial Sketches</h3>
				<p>I always start off with drawing initial low-fi wireframes in my sketchbook to help me explore concepts and trying different layouts.</p>

				<h3 class="sect-title">Branding and Design System</h3>
				<p>Before designing screens on Figma, I created the branding for TicketFlip. This would include typography and the colour palette that would be used. </p>
			</div>
				<img src="assets/images/ticketflip/ticketflip_branding.png" data-action="zoom">
			<div class="container-case">
				<p>I also create a design system that would go along with TicketFlip. The image below shows variations of the components that I played with while designing TicketFlip.</p>

				<h3 class="sect-title">Facebook Chat Extension</h3>
				<p>According to the users I've interviewed and based on what I see on social media, most second-hand ticket transactions occur on Facebook (either the event page or a music-related group). What would make the process more efficient is creating a Facebook extension that would connect to the TicketFlip app. Users would post the link on the event page discussion or FB group, or can direct message potential buyers or sellers. Clicking on the link would send the user to the ticket's listing page on TicketFlip.</p>
				<img src="assets/images/ticketflip/ticketflip_fbchat.png" data-action="zoom">
				<p>As this project is still ongoing, I may look into Facebook chatbots where users can potentially find tickets quickly using the bot and the app.</p> 
				<h3 class="sect-title">Ticket Listing Page</h3>
				<p>The ticket listing page is the bread and butter of TicketFlip. At the top of the page, there would be the seller's information. Sellers can attach a message to their listing and it would also show more details. This would include if the seller has been ID Verified and their social media pages as well. With additional verification, users would feel more safe in buying tickets from strangers online.</p> 
				<img src="assets/images/ticketflip/ticketflip_mockup2.png" data-action="zoom">
				<p> Additionally, I've also included a ticket value component on the listing page. This would show users the face value and average price of the ticket which can tell if users are getting a good deal or if they're buying from a scalper.</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">Home Page</h3>
				<p>I've also included a home page where users are able to have easy access to their tickets and listings.</p>
				<img src="assets/images/ticketflip/ticketflip_mockup3.png" data-action="zoom">
				<h3 class="sect-title">Next Steps</h3>
				<p>As this project is still ongoing right now, I am looking to test this platform with my users to validate my design decisions. After designing these screens, I realized that a few flows and components are missing. This includes how a user would create a listing and a user's profile. Afterwards I would begin to clean up the design and begin adding interaction and motion to this project. Stay tuned for the next part of the project!</p>
