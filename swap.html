				<p class="case-subtitle">Jan 2019</p>
				<p>In the Entertainment industry, there is a risk of selling second-hand tickets due to scammers and scalpers. As seen online, usually on Facebook or any other social media platforms, there are always people sharing stories of how they’ve been scammed or to watch out for the person that scammed them.</p>
				<p>There are currently no mechanisms in place to perfectly trade second-hand tickets. TicketMaster partially fixed this problem by being able to transfer your ticket to another person but there is still the friction of the transaction or possibility of getting scammed because both transactions do not occur concurrently. The experience can be much better and easier than current methods. This platform is not a marketplace but is more of a tool to assist with the current ticket-trading methods.</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">What problem is this platform solving?</h3>
				<p>When buying and selling second-hand tickets, there is always some sort of distrust between both parties. There is always emotion associated with these transactions as there's always a risk of losing money. The problem I’m trying to solve is the ability for others to trust each other online and making the second-hand ticket trading experience easier for users.</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">User Research</h3>
				<p>The purpose of this research is to collect qualitative data to understand their emotions when the ticket-trading experience is happening and to listen to anecdotal stories related to this experience. For my research, I interviewed five users.</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">Insights</h3>
				<p>Buyers and sellers will mainly use Facebook as a marketplace for second-hand tickets as there are much more people trading there. Prices are also closer to face-value than a second-hand trading marketplace such as StubHub. People will be typically looking for tickets on the event’s Facebook event page or music-related groups.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>When buying a second-hand ticket from strangers on social media such as Facebook, they will try identifying if the seller is a scammer or not by looking at their profile details such as mutual friends, posts and photos</li>
					<li>Even though the other party may seem trustworthy, people will still have the thought of a possibility of getting scammed or cheated for their money</li>
					<li>Users don’t like using second-hand ticket marketplaces such as StubHub because there's no face to the seller and prices are much higher. A study by Adventus has also said that people view these second-hand ticket marketplaces as unethical because of the higher prices (e.g. buying from scalpers and the fees associated with using these marketplaces).</li>
					<li>Users always have the fear of the ticket not scanning upon entry, which may cause embarrassment at the door and dealing with the hassle of finding and buying another ticket.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="sect-title">User Persona</h3>
				<h3 class="sect-title">Jobs-to-be-Done Framework</h3>
				<p>For this project I wanted to try creating a job story using the Jobs-to-be-Done Framework to understand what task the user is doing and why they would hire this product. For this framework, I took a look at three different criterias.</p>

				<p>Afterwards I created a job story based on the three different criterias.</p>
