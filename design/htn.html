					<h3 class="sect-title">background</h3>
					<p><a href="https://hackthenorth.com/" target=_blank>Hack the North</a> is Canada's largest hackathon held at the University of Waterloo. We bring over 1000 students from over 22 countries to build and create over a period of 36 hours.</p>
					<P>For the past two years, I was a part of the Hack the North organizing team as a Product Designer. I've worked on various projects such as the mobile app, the volunteer dashboard, and other various assets that was needed for the event.</P>

					<h3 class="sect-title">2018 Website Animation</h3>
					<p>Every year the Hack the North team changes our branding. We wanted to be very different from previous years so we decided to stray away from the monochromatic blue branding to something more colourful and as well as include illustrations.</p>
					<p>This year, <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/graciexiaa" target=_blank>Gracie Xia</a>, an excellent illustrator and designer lead the illustrations for 2018's branding. She lead the website hero's illustration and while I illustrated some minor parts of the hero such as the robot or people and as well as being in charge of animating the illustration on Adobe After Effects. Check out the live version of the animation <a href="https://hackthenorth.com/" target=_blank>here</a> on our website.</p>

				<h3 class="sect-title-space">2018 Mobile App</h3>
				<p>The Hack the North team also develops a mobile app every year to support the event. The mobile app includes features such as a schedule, map, live updates, FAQ, and a mentorship tool to connect mentors with hackers to help with their projects. This year I was in charge of designing the overall app while another Product Designer on the team, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman-mathur" target=_blank>Aman Mathur</a>, was in the charge of the mentorship portion of the app.</p>
				<h4 class="sect-subtitle">Audit, requirements &amp; feedback</h4>
				<p>I started off this project by auditing the 2017 mobile app that I've designed previously with another member on Hack the North. We've also took a look at the feedback we've from the hackers. Here were some problems and requirements we can address for the new day-of app:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>As a hacker, they will be primarily on their laptop working on their project. The app was only available by downloading it in the app store.</li>
						<li>At Hack the North we have a lot of activities, workshops, and events occuring at the same time. The full schedule can be overwhelming to some.</li>
						<li>The sponsorship team upgraded the sponsor packages and now require information such as a sponsor's API prize, workshop, blurbs, and videos on their own subpage.</li>
						<li>Find a way to fit judging into the schedule so hackers can easily find when and where their project will be judged.</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Some problems were addressed by the development team such as them creating a progressive web app so it would be more readily available. We've also designed a desktop version of the app so that hackers can easily access it when they are working on their project.</p>

				<p class="subtitle">Previous versions and mockups of the day-of app that lead to the final design.</p>
				<h4 class="sect-subtitle" style="margin-top: 0;">Login Flow</h4>
				<p>For this years app we've decided to allow hackers and non-hackers outside of the event to access our app without logging in so information would be more readily available. We still wanted hackers to login to our app to keep track of their data so we've restricted access to some actions of the app such as the ability to create your own schedule or restricting access to your profile.</p>
				<p>When the user tries to access those parts of the app, it prompts the user to login. The copy was also contextual so if a user were to access their own schedule, the copy would say "To gain full access to features, such as <b>adding events to your schedule</b> on the Hack the North day-of app, you must sign in to your Hack the North account, for example.</p>

					<h4 class="sect-subtitle" style="margin-top: 0;">Schedule</h4>
					<p>The schedule was difficult to tackle as there could be as many as 15 events happening at once. To make the schedule legible with multiple events I went with a horizontal scrollable schedule organized by location. I also colour-coded each event by their respective category such as food, workshop, etc. so hackers can find what kind of event they wanted to attend and as well as adding the ability to filter by category. I've also added the ability to allow hackers to create their own schedule by favouriting each event as a schedule as big as this can be overwhelming to some.</p>
					<p>For hackers to easily see where and when their project will be judged, I also created a judging section in their schedule. Hackers can find their judging schedule by searching their team name and as well as favouriting that event so they can see it on their own schedule.</p>

					<h4 class="sect-subtitle" style="margin-top: 0;">Day-of Landing Page & Entry Point</h4>
					<p>For full visibility on our schedule and sponsorship information, I designed a simple landing page for the day-of landing page. When you visit our website, hackers can enter the day-of app by clicking on the hero's CTA or the CTA below the day-of app features. We also wanted the livestream to be accessible so I threw that in as well on the hero.</p>

				<h4 class="sect-subtitle">Conclusion</h3>
				<p>From tackling this project I've learned quite a bit about designing an app holistically. This project made me think more deeply about the interactions between each component of the app including something as simple as how a user would enter into the app itself or logging into the app. Designing each screen also helped me think more deeply about the states for every component of the app as well. For more next project, I would love to look more deeply into interactions, states, and as well as creating the animations for each interaction. Below are some more sample screens I've designed for the Hack the North 2018 day-of app.</p>
