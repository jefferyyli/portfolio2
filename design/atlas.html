				<p class="case-subtitle">Nov 2018</p>
				<p>On one hot summer day in July of 2018, I was sent away to Alberta for a client project while I was interning at Deloitte. Naturally I spent my weekends in the mountains since that is what Alberta is most known for. I’ve never seen mountains before until I arrived in Banff--I wanted to explore and hike everything I could see.</p>
				<p>While on top of Sulphur Mountain starring at the endless view of mountains, I came to a realization. What if I could point my phone at the mountains and my device could give me information on that certain mountain? As a sole Product Designer on this project, I spent my time researching, designing, prototyping and testing this concept.</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">My personal goals for this project</h3>
				<p>This project was meant for the development of my skills in various areas in design. I wanted to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Conduct and analyze my own user research, which included surveying, interviewing users, and creating personas</li>
					<li>Explore various user testing methods I’ve never tried before in attempt to creating a better product</li>
					<li>Improve my visual and UI design skills using Sketch</li>
					<li>Develop my interaction design skills, including the creation of animated prototypes on Origami Studio and Adobe After Effects</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="sect-title">User research and analysis</h3>
				<p>Before I began this project, I surveyed 23 users and conducted 6 interviews on users that have experience in hiking in mountains when travelling.</p>
				<p>To better understand the decision making behind choosing hikes, I asked users to rank their top reasons for choosing a hike. The top 3 reasons were:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Scenery and view</li>
					<li>Difficulty level — this includes elevation, distance, and length of time</li>
					<li>Location— how far the hike is from where the user currently is</li>
				</ol>
				<img src="../assets/images/atlas/artifact-1.jpg" data-action="zoom">
				<p class="subtitle">Ranking of most important qualities users look for in a hike from most to least important by data collected from interviews and survey</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">Other sample insights I pulled from my research:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Hazards and safety was also important in the decision-making process—sites and apps that listed information for hikes did not have this type of information available</li>
					<li>50% of the users I interviewed said that it was difficult to find the trailhead or they were confused about the paths</li>
					<li>82.6% of users that were surveyed said they were interested in learning about the history of a mountain they were hiking; 1 users I interviewed also said that the history and uniqueness of a mountain is one reason why they decide to hike a certain mountain</li>
					<li>65.4% of users discover hikes through a Google search, or from friends or family</li>
					<li>According to users and secondary research, difficulty levels, time and distance of hikes were inconsistent throughout different sites, blogs, and apps</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="subtitle">How users discover hikes and how they plan routes for hikes — data collected from survey</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">Persona of a hiker</h3>
				<p>For my interviews I wanted to talk to users that typically did not hike often or at all, and users that were experienced in hiking. Luckily I was also able to talk to users that were from a mountainous region where hiking would be much more common.</p>
				<p>Below is what the average experienced and beginner hiker looks like based on the data I collected from my interviews.</p>

			<div class="container-case">
				<p>I also believed that there was another user type as well: the expert hiker, users that would do multi-day hikes and hiked very often. Unfortunately, I was not able to talk to these users due to geographical constraints and lacked the network to find these users.</p>
				<p>Regardless, I had enough information to start designing Atlas—which is primarily focused on the beginner and experienced hikers.</p>
				<h3 class="sect-title">Wireframes, initial designs and flow</h3>
				<p>After creating my personas and insights, I started drawing wireframes with pen and paper, and mid-fi on Sketch as well.</p>

			<div class="container-case">
				<p>Because I wanted my designs to reflect the mountains, I decided to go with a sharper look. I wanted to use blues and purples as that was what also reminded me of the mountains.</p>
				<p>After completing the first version of screens, I tested it on 5 users with various testing methods. In between testing sessions, I was reiterating the design based on the feedback I collected from the previous testing session in preparation for the next.</p>

				<h3 class="sect-title">User flow</h3>
				<p>Below is the user flow I created for Atlas. Through creating this flow, I realized that the trail info page is the most important feature of this concept as most parts of the app will go back to it.</p>

				<h3 class="sect-title">Task flow</h3>
				<p>I also created a task flow for the AR Discovery and Save to list feature.</p>

				<h3 class="sect-title">Discovering mountains using AR</h3>
				<p>The idea that sparked this entire project. Once a user sees a mountain, they would be able to scan it by holding down the screen. As the app finds the mountain, the user would be able to preview some basic information on the mountain. By swiping up on the bottom drawer, users can see a full detailed profile of that mountain including the hiking information such as hazards and routes.</p>

				<h3 class="sect-title">Improving the hiking discovery experience</h3>
				<img src="../assets/images/atlas/atlas-2.gif" data-action="zoom">
				<p>Through my research, I discovered there was a need for additional and accurate information for hiking trails.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hazards + Additional Info: Users are typically concerned with how dangerous the hike would be which would impact their decision making. For instance, one user usually avoids hikes where they must scale or climb rocks to get to the peak. Bears, unpaved and pet-friendly trails was also a concern for some users as well.</li>
					<li>Weather: Beginners were not prepared for hikes on mountains with high peaks because they were unaware of the temperature and weather difference closer to the top.</li>
					<li>Sunset/Sunrise: 50% of the experienced users has said that they time their hikes so that they would be able to catch a perfect sunset view from the peak. I included times of when the sun will rise/set and the direction of where the sun will be setting/rising.</li>
					<li>Peak times: 50% of the users I interviewed has mentioned that they prefer hiking in less populated areas because they enjoy the solidarity and peace. A card was designed to show users when the trail would be populated by time and day.</li>
					<li>Navigation: 50% of the users have mentioned that some apps or websites have confused them on getting them to the trailhead or the trail splitting in different paths. During testing, some users also showed interest in Atlas helping them navigate during the trail.</li>
